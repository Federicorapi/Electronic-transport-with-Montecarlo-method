# Electronic-transport-with-Montecarlo-method
Matlab script for the Montecarlo simulation of electronic transport in a crystalline materials developed during the course "Electronic transport in crystalline and organic semiconductors" - Politecnico di Torino, a.y. 2019-2020
I modelized all the different scattering mechanisms present in crystalline structures in single ".m" scripts and then integrated integrated them inside the "montecarlo.m" script containg the simulation
